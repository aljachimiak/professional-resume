    "summary": "<p>After 15 years teaching in public schools, I made a huge leap into the software industry.  Every day of my teaching career was an exercise in User Experience. What could I do to ease a student through the constant bombardment of new material? How could I make a student comfortable enough with unfamilliar information so they are willing to engage in the learning process?</p><p> I've taken this experience and integrated with my passion for technology.  Now, I develop front-end user interfaces that are easy to use and create back-end API's that are developer-friendly, maitainable, and scalable.",
