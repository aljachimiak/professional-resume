    "summary": "<p>I’m a self-taught engineer that is about to start his 6th year as a professional in the tech industry.  I develop front-end user interfaces that are easy to use and create back-end API's that are engineer-friendly, maintainable, and scalable.</p><p>As an engineer, I’ve got lots of experience using React and Vue to make great user interfaces. On the backend, I've written services in nodejs and go, as well as several years of experience in C#.</p><p>I’m also good communicator. In my previous career as a public school teacher, I helped students understand complex topics by first understanding the topics and then communicating the material in an impactful way. I bring that experience to technology companies by understanding both the business and technology problems, and translating the needs of stakeholders to create a plan for success that is sustainable across teams.</p>",
